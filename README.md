**SONAR Rocks vs Mines Prediction**

This project focuses on the binary classification of objects as either rocks or mines using sonar signals. Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, was used for the classification task. The goal of this project is to create a predictive system that can accurately distinguish between rocks and mines using the SONAR dataset.

**Introduction**

The SONAR Rocks vs Mines Prediction project leverages Logistic Regression to classify objects as rocks or mines based on sonar signal data. This project involves several steps, including data importation, pre-processing, splitting the data into training and test sets, and training the logistic regression model. The final predictive system helps determine whether the input sonar data corresponds to a rock or a mine.

**Dataset Information**

The dataset used in this project is the SONAR dataset, which consists of 208 sonar observations. Each observation has 60 features, representing the energy of sonar signals at different frequencies.

Features: 60 continuous variables representing sonar signal energy levels.
Target: (R = Rock, M = Mine).

**Steps Involved**

**Importing the SONAR Data:**

The SONAR dataset is imported and explored to understand the distribution of features and target variables.

**Data Pre-processing:**

Pre-processing steps include handling missing data, normalizing features, and ensuring the target variable is properly labeled.

**Train/Test Split:**

The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Typically, 90% of the data is used for training and 10% for testing.

**Logistic Regression Model:**

A Logistic Regression model is used to classify the observations. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated using the test set.

**Model Performance**

The Logistic Regression model achieved the following performance metrics:

Training Accuracy: 86%
Test Accuracy: 76%
These results indicate that the model performs reasonably well in predicting whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine, with an opportunity for further improvement by exploring other classification models.

**Usage**

The predictive system developed in this project allows users to input sonar signal data and receive predictions about whether the object is a rock or a mine. The system is designed to take numerical input for all features and output a prediction.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how logistic regression can be applied to binary classification tasks like the SONAR dataset for distinguishing between rocks and mines. With a test accuracy of 76%, the model provides a good starting point for further optimization. Future improvements could involve experimenting with different machine learning algorithms or fine-tuning the existing model.
